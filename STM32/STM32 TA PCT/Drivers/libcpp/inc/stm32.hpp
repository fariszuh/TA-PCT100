/**

 *
 * This library is designed for the STM32F4 family of microcontrollers. It makes
 * extensive use of C++ and templates. The use of templates will cause a larger
 * code size, but in many cases makes code that is both extremely easy to read
 * and extremely fast.
 *
 * This library provides example projects and library code for things such as:
 *
 *  - \ref Gpio "Easy IO Access"
 *  - \ref Usart "Serial port driver"
 *  - Motor and encoder drivers
 *    - Encoder A library for using quadrature encoders.
 *    - A4940 A library for controlling an Allegro A4940 motor driver with TIM1 or
 *      TIM8. This library can also be used on many other motor chips.
 *    - Ncv7729 A library for controller the Ncv7729 motor driver, as used on the
 *      FitItInSoftware control board.
 *  - Sensor drivers
 *    - MiniImu9v2 An interface to the low-cost Pololu IMU.
 *  - \ref flash_storage "FLASH memory access"
 *  - \ref DelayH "Delay Routines"
 *
 * For usage guidelines and environment setup, see the project page at
